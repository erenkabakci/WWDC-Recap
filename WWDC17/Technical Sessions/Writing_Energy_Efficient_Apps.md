## Background processing
  - Avoid as much as possible
  - Finish work quickly and efficiently
  - Use background app refresh for updating content
  - Use completion handler so that you complete
  - New - PushKitAPI - has completion() now.

## Navigation background mode
  - CPU limits like workout
  - Minimize Networking

## Energy debugging tools
  - Energy Gauges
  - Debug your app for
    - Launch & idle
    - Background
  - E.g: For a navigation app: debug for,
    - Search for and address
    - Get directions
